Golang + (Postgre)SQL: how they work together?
============

## About

Exploring the magic behind Go, SQL and stuff that bonds them together.


## But why?

I just want to have a deeper practice with SQL and begin to use it in my projects. 
So, that is a project where I will put all random stuff I learned about SQL in Go.

## SQL driver used

```
github.com/lib/pq
```

## Source of studying

I'm currently just follow this guide:
```
http://go-database-sql.org/
```

## What I have done by now

It opens a database! And can get some info from it using one magic function!
